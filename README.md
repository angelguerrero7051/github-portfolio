### 📂 Projects & Research Highlights

- **🌍 HERA Capstone**  
  Designed a real-time Arduino-based system to collect microbes at 15 km altitude. Integrated C++ sensor controls for stratospheric conditions and presented project via [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nZfStZPTZssERJ0TnQ5ofVAft1nvwwe9YFBu4VFlwhQ/view).

- **🧬 NSURP Meta-Analysis – NASA GeneLab**  
  Conducted transcriptomic meta-analysis on microgravity experiments (rodents, *C. elegans*, human cells). Analyzed DEGs, performed ortholog mapping, pathway enrichment, and network modeling using Python/R.

- **🧪 OHSU Bioinformatics Internship**  
  Used UseGalaxy and machine learning to study viral co-infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and microRNA expression. Presented findings at ABRCMS 2024 and mentored junior interns.

- **🚀 NASA L'SPACE Academy**  
  Led systems engineering for a robotic mission concept. Oversaw subsystem integration using Siemens NX and thermal analysis, aligned with NASA’s proposal standards.

- **🧬 Case Study Between Sleep and Mental Health**  
  This project analyzed NHANES data from 6,652 U.S. adults to examine how sleep duration relates to depressive symptoms and self-rated health. Using ANOVA and regression analyses, the study found that poorer general health, depressive symptoms, sleep trouble, and more days of poor mental health are all associated with shorter sleep duration. Overall, the results support a significant link between healthier sleep patterns and better mental health and well-being.
